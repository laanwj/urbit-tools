    As much fun as a barrel of puppies

Urbit utility functions implemented in Python 3:

- `cue` - Unpack ('unjam') nouns
- `de:crua` - Decode network packets
- `@p` - Ship number to scrambled ship name

Command-line tools:

- `namebrute.py` - Find ship names that match entries a word list or dictionary
- `urbit_sniffer.py` - Network sniffer that parses urbit packets, decodes them (if the key is available) and
   dumpes their contents to the console
